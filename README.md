Hello MobilePop team!

I went ahead and took a crack at making emulating the Photoshop mockup.  I used
Ionic Framework because I am very comfortable working with it and it also has a 
built in side-menu so that made things pretty simple for me.  Overall things went
pretty smoothly!  There is still a good amount of code that simply comes with 
the simple Ionic app that is given that I did not bother removing.

To see the app, simply download and run in your browser using localhost.
